### Mobile Support
- The application is functional on mobile devices but not fully optimized

### Player System
- Players are tracked by their slot position (Player 1, 2, 3, 4)

- Statistics are tied to the player slot, not the name
- This design choice simplifies data management but may be improved in future versions

- Data persists between sessions on the same device/browser

- No cloud sync or cross-device support
- Regular backups via Export are recommended

### Optimal Configuration
- **Players**: Designed for 3 players (1, 2, or 4 players may have visual issues)
- **Theme**: Dark mode is the primary theme with better visual consistency
- **Browser**: Chrome or Firefox on desktop for best experience
