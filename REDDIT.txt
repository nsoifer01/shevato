I Made a Mario Kart Race Tracker Because I Couldn't Find a Good One

Hey r/mariokart! (or wherever this gets posted)

I've been playing Mario Kart with friends regularly and wanted a way to track our race results over time. I searched around but couldn't find a decent tracker that had all the features I wanted, so I decided to build my own.

## What it does:

**Basic Features:**
- Track race results for 2-4 players
- Record finishing positions (1-24) for each race
- Automatic stat calculations (win rates, average positions, etc.)
- Full undo/redo support
- Date filtering to view specific time periods
- Export/import data as JSON files
- Dark/light mode (dark mode works better)

**Cool Analytics:**
- **Achievement System**: Track streaks and milestones like Win Streaks, Hot Streaks, Perfect Days, and more
- **Head-to-Head Stats**: See detailed matchup data between any two players
- **Performance Trends**: Charts showing how you're improving (or not üòÖ) over time
- **Activity Heatmap**: Calendar view showing when you race and how well you did
- **Position Analysis**: See which positions you finish in most often

**UI Features:**
- Clean, modern card-based design
- Smooth animations and hover effects
- Multiple input methods (quick add widget, dropdown, direct entry)
- Customizable player names and emoji icons
- Responsive design (though mobile needs work)

## Try it out:

## Some notes:
- It saves everything in your browser's localStorage (no accounts needed)
- Works best on desktop Chrome/Firefox
- Mobile works but isn't perfect yet (especially the trends chart)
- Optimized for 3 players but supports 2-4
- Players are tracked by slot position, not name (explained in the help section)

I've attached some screenshots showing the different views and a sample JSON file if you want to see how the data looks with some races already tracked.

This is still a work in progress and I'm planning to improve it based on how my friends and I use it. Any feedback is appreciated! Let me know if you find it useful or if there are features you'd like to see added.

Happy racing! üèÅ
